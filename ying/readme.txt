Tried adding a 'nothing' class to stop movement of Google Earth when there are no hands in the ROI box but does not really work so I should probably add a lot more random images to the dataset (?)

Current validation accuracy is around 40% (yuck). Still tweaking model hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
