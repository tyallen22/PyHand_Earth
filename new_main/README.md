"data" folder contains 3 separate directories for the training, validation, and testing sets

To add to the dataset, run "capture_images.py" and there will be apparent instructions on the screen. It would be nice if the ratio for training:validation:testing can be kept around 70:15:15.

To test the second model, switch to "ying/testing-expanded-model" branch in the new_main folder. Some code is tweaked and the model would not work with the current master branch.

Please download the h5 model file at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A3eDzy-1cJiadcE8arPyZJepxoRfoZGl/view?usp=sharing. file_download.py is not downloading correctly for me right now.
