## Installation

 ### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher 
- Compatible with Ubuntu 20.04


### Dependencies needed:

- Google Earth desktop (will be installed automatically if it is not already present in the environment)
- apt-get dependencies required to make pip installed packages work together 

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

Needed for pip installed pyautogui

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0
```
Required in order to start PyQt, which is pip installed

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install wmctrl
```
Necessary for us to manage certain windows

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install scrot
```
needed in order to locate images in the Google Earth application so that we can make sure it behaves properly

### Setup

  - This section will include all the `code` necessary to get  PyHand-Earth going
  
  #### Requirements: 
  
- TensorFlow 2.2.0
- OpenCV 4.2.0.34
- matplotlib 3.2.2
- Keras 2.4.2
- pyautogui 0.9.50
- PyQt5
- psutil 5.7.0



> install all requirements for PyHand-Earth with:

```shell

$ pip3 install PyHand-Earth

```

  OR

> install them individually with:

  

```shell

$ pip3 install opencv-python==4.2.0.34

$ pip3 install matplotlib==3.2.2

$ pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow==2.2.0

$ pip3 install Keras==2.4.2

$ pip3 install pyautogui==0.9.50

$ pip3 install PyQt5

$ pip3 install psutil==5.7.0

```





## Start 


#### To  Start PyHand-Earth:
- Navigate to the virtual environment folder, pip install pyhand-earth, then cd lib/python3.8/site-packages/PyHand-Earth/tyler/testing/new, then python3 [main_qt.py](http://main_qt.py/ "http://main_qt.py/")


```shell

$ python3 main_qt.py

```

- Two windows will show up:

	- Google Earth Pro: Targeted window to control with hand gestures
	
	- Gestures and buttons window : Demonstrating different possible gestures and buttons to start the OpenCV window video, Stop it and Exit the program which closes all the windows.

## Usage 

 
- This section will go over all menu buttons and functionalities.

### DISCLAIMER: Optimization of both of the programs has to be improved in order to make Google Earth more responsive. Model must be further developed to improve accuracy. 

 ### Buttons

To test the second model, switch to "ying/testing-expanded-model" branch in the new_main folder. Some code is tweaked and the model would not work with the current master branch.
