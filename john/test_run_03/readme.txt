This version is a stand-alone file that embeds an OpenCV window, together with
the TensorFlow training model.  Not included is the PyAutoGui manipulation
feature. It is still in a very rudimentary form.  Note that the Start button at
the bottom of the screen will pause/restart the image capturing.

You must include the .h5 Keras training model fil in the same directory, as
well as the PyQt helper module interface.py.

You can download the latest .h5 file, which is too large to upload to GitHub apparently, at this link:
