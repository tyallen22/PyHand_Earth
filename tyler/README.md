# Steps for using PyHandEarth Shell Script

*DISCLAIMER: I don't how this will work if you already have parts of this installed. I deleted Google Earth Pro and the virtual environment prior to running this and it installed everything as expected on my system.*

Make sure to download the PyHand_Earth repo from github before running this script. The script will download the model to /home/your_username_here/Desktop/PyHand_Earth/tyler/testing/pyearth_cnn_model_200612_1744.h5 by default.
Edit the last part of the curl command on line 29 of the script to change the directory if necessary.

1. Download PyHandEarth.sh

2. Place the file in your /home/your_username_here/ directory

3. In terminal, navigate to /home/your_username_here/ directory
- You can access this directory in the terminal using `cd ~` or `cd /home/your_username_here`

4. Run `chmod +x PyHandEarth.sh` in terminal. 
- This sets the execute permission for a shell script

5. Run `./PyHandEarth` in terminal. 
- This executes the shell script

### After Running the Script
- Google Earth Pro should be installed and accessible in your app drawer 
- Additionally, a virtual environment folder and the needed project dependencies should be created at /home/your_username_here/earth01
- As mentioned at the top, the model will be downloaded to /home/your_username_here/Desktop/PyHand_Earth/john/test_run_02
